# Django application development

My Django application development environment. Supposed to make my life easier by allowing faster and easy way to test and develop django applications.

I'm trying to keep this quite clean, so only applications I'm going to publish gets committed.

## How to

For something basic, you only need to run following.

```shell
docker-compose up
python manage.py migrate
```

And maybe install or create some apps to mess with.
